    UCL TechSoc runs weekly gaming sessions throughout the term time, inviting gamers of any calibre and skill level. We normally play a set genre of game each week that will be announced on the <a href="{% include facebook.href %}">Facebook group</a>, but we'll occasionally have days allowing everyone to play whatever people feel like playing, ranging from old school retro games to the newest AAA titles. 
</p>
<p>
    We also occasionally hold Intercollegiate events where we will invite other universities and gaming societies to come and play games with us and chill out and spark some fierce competitive spirit and go head to head with them. 
</p>
<p>
    We're also hosting a Mumble server to allow people to use voice communications whilst playing games together and to find other gamers to party up with or to just chill out and chat with people. The details for the server can be found below:

    <ul>
        <li>Address: TBA</li>
        <li>Port: TBA</li>
    </ul>

    So whether you're a PC gamer, console gamer or you just like to watch people play games and shout at each other, come join us at the next event and play some games with us!
